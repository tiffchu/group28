## Project Summary
The aim of this project is to look at the Iris dataset, and figure out if certain features are useful for the classification of iris species. We hope to answer "Can we predict the Iris species using petal and sepal measurements?". By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we seek to accurately predict the species of iris flowers from given measurements.
